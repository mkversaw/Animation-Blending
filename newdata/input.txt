# Each line starts with a keyword:
# - TEXTURE <texture file>
# - MESH <obj file> <skin file> <texture file>
# - SKELETON <skeleton file>
# Alpha blending is used to render the mouth, eyes, and brows. Since the brows mesh covers the eyes mesh,
# the brows mesh should be rendered after the eyes mesh.
# Lines for textures in automatically generated input file could be wrong when there are multiple textures, please modify them manually.
